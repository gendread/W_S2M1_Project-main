<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

            <p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.</p>

            <p>When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes. Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.</p>
